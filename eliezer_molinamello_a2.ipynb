This can be optimized by analizing the list more efficiently without generating a full range. This can also affect the space complexity negatively due memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Another related suggestion is to find a way to optimize the algorithm by not having to sort the list every time we run the code. For instance, using data structures like `hash sets` to track numbers can potentially be a good option as if would find missing numbers without generating a full range.\n",
        "\n",

For someone new or unfamiliar to algorithms and/or numpy having few comments makes the code harder to understand. However, Kamal provided quite a comprehensive explanation to both his actual and alternative solution."

Then I started writing some test code and the part where I spent most of my time was creating the `if` statements as I have never coded anything similar before. What also helped me was to search for additional help on `stackoverflow` and other forums. Then, I started testing my code with my own examples to verify whether it gave me the correct output. This took quite a few trials and errors but in the end I was able to effectively generate the correct output.\n",
